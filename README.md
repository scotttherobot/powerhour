Power Hour
==========

Theory
------

A wine power hour is a drinking game. Each minute, you take a shot (1.5oz) of wine.
After 60 minutes, you've theoretically consumed 90oz of wine, over 3.5 bottles. 
Whomever makes it longest is clearly superior.

Features
--------

The PowerHour webapp facilitates mediating the game. Typically, someone has to monitor 
the time, tally shots, etc. All of this bookkeeping is done automatically using the
PowerHour webapp.

The main draw is perhaps the timer function. A countdown is displayed onscreen, and 
each minute the timer triggers any combination of visual and auditory alerts. It also
automatically increments the shot tally if it is in true-to-time mode. Alternatively,
user interaction can be required to confirm that the shot was taken.
