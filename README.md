Power Hour
==========

Theory
------

A wine power hour is a drinking game. Each minute, you take a shot (1.5oz) of wine.
After 60 minutes, that's 90oz of wine, over 3.5 bottles. Whomever makes it longest
is clearly superior.

Features
--------

The PowerHour webapp facilitates mediating the game. Typically, someone has to monitor 
the time, tally shots, etc. All of this bookkeeping is done automatically.

* Global shot tally based on time
* Individual shot tally
* Aggregate shots consumed
	* (shots by time) x (players)
	* ml consumed
	* bottles consumed
